This is a collection of libraries commonly known as NCEPLIBS that are
required for several NCEP applications e.g. UFS, GSI, UPP, etc. For
general information about NCEPLIBS, the user is referred to the
[Wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS/wiki).

See the full documentation for each of the NCEPLIBS projects:

- [NCEPLIBS-bacio](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-bacio/) This
  library performs binary I/O for the NCEP models, processing
  unformatted byte-addressable data records, and transforming the
  little endian files and big endian files.

- [NCEPLIBS-bufr](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-bufr/) Fortran
  programs and command line utilites for working with the BUFR format.

- EMC-crtm Community Radiative Transfer Model This is a snapshot of
  the CRTM used within EMC applications.

- [NCEPLIBS-g2](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-g2/)

- NCEPLIBS-g2tmpl Utilities for GRIB2 templates.

- NCEPLIBS-gfsio API to convert GFS Gaussian output into grib output.

- [NCEPLIBS-ip](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-ip/) Fortran 90
  subprograms to be used for interpolating between nearly all
  (rectilinear) grids used at NCEP.

- NCEPLIBS-landsfcutil Utility routines useful for initializing
  land-surface states in NCEP models.

- [NCEPLIBS-nemsio](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-nemsio/)
  Performs I/O for the NCEP models using NEMS.

- NCEPLIBS-nemsiogfs Performs I/O for the NEMS-GFS model.

- EMC_post Post processing.

- [NCEPLIBS-sfcio](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-sfcio/) API for
  surface files I/O.

- [NCEPLIBS-sigio](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-sigio/)
  Application Program Interface for performing I/O on the sigma
  restart file of the global spectral model.

- [NCEPLIBS-sp](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-sp/) FORTRAN
  subprograms to be used for a variety of spectral transform
  functions.

- NCEPLIBS-w3emc Fortran 90 decoder/encoder routines for GRIB edition
  1.

- NCEPLIBS-w3nco Fortran 90 decoder/encoder routines for GRIB edition
  1.

- [NCEPLIBS-wrf_io](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-wrf_io) This
  is a lightweight WRF-IO API library for Unified Post Processor
  (UPP).

- NCEPLIBS-ip2 Fortran 90 subprograms to be used for interpolating
  between nearly all grids used at NCEP.

- [NCEPLIBS-wgrib2](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/)
  Provides functionality for interacting with, reading, writing, and
  manipulating grib2 files, with a CMake build.

- [NCEPLIBS-g2c](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-g2c/) C
  decoder/encoder routines for GRIB edition 2

- [NCEPLIBS-grib_util](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-grib_util/)
  A collection of NCEP grib related utilities.

- [NCEPLIBS-prod_util](https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-prod_util/)
  Product utilities for the NCEP models.
